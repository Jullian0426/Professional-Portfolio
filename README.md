# Professional Portfolio

## Description

This website is a portfolio where I will later display my work to potential employers. By building this website I further practiced semantic html element usage and became more familiar with css styling and positioning, specifically through the use of flexboxes. It also served as practice creating a mock-up design for a website and coding it from scratch.
